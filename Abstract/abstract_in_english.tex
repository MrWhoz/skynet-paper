As the environment and traffic situations nowadays, the needs of information about those two are very important but limited the supplier. Therefore, we studied and made this project about the system of collecting environment elements as well as traffic data by sensor nodes. Thank to the explosive development of Internet of Things and based on knowledge about the linking between quality of environment and elements which is proved in Pre-Thesis state, we continued to develop to the final Thesis project. At this state, we built the entirely new system which featuring a new sensor node that can operate without the main power grid and can resist the harsh weather conditions like extremely sunny or heavy raining. Moreover, we provided the friendly website and mobile app to user as well as useful APIs for third party developer.
